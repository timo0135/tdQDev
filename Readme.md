<h1> CharleBin </h1>



<p> The goal of the project is to recreate the "pasteBin" site with a few differences:</p>

<p> CharleBin is a site that allows users to write messages and send them to the people of their choice with a link. </p>

<p> The "pasteBin" site does not keep your messages private whereas in CharleBin this is the case.</p>

<p> Due to CharleBin you can send your messages in complete security. </p>
